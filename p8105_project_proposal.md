P8105 Project Proposal
================

## Tentative Project Title

-   Double A: Asthma and Air Quality
-   The A2 Project: Air Quality and Asthma

## Group Members

-   Tara Ahi (*ta2645*)
-   Gunnar Colleen (*jgc2157*)
-   Mandy Miles (*acm2268*)
-   Jodi Scharf (*jys2137*)
-   Jocelyn Sun (*jys2136*)

## Project Motivation

Global rise in temperature is associated with the rise in frequency of
wildfire outbreaks across the nation, specifically the Pacific
Northwest. The air quality resulting in these fires are not only
concentrated in the Pacific Northwest, but also travel across the
country by wind patterns. We are looking to explore the relationship
between PM2.5 density and the cases of asthma over time due to fires,
car exhaust, (etc for other PM2.5 causes). And provide visualizations of
these patterns over time.

## Intended final products (including planned visualizations and analyses)

-   **Website** with background information, sources of data
-   **Visualizations**, including maps that show change in density of PM
    2.5 over time, trends of CO2, asthma density
-   **2020-2021 specific data visualization** to see the how air
    pollution had changed during the pandemic as a result of less human
    activity
-   **Statistical analyses** of the prevalence/cumulative incidence of
    cases of asthma and the association with air quality.
-   Possible **implications** for policies and COP26
-   Potential **sub-analysis** regarding wildfires and asthma

## Anticipated data sources

-   **BRFSS** (contains asthma, COPD, and other chronic disease data)
    -   [BRFSS
        Annual](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2020.html)
-   **Top 100 Asthma Capitals** by year (includes during COVID up
    to 2021)
    -   [Asthma Capitals](https://www.aafa.org/asthma-capitals/)
    -   [2021 Asthma
        Report](https://www.aafa.org/media/3040/aafa-2021-asthma-capitals-report.pdf)
-   **EPA Datasets**
    -   [Daily EPA Pollution
        Dataset](https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html#Daily)
    -   [Annual EPA AQI
        Data](https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html#Annual)
    -   [EPA air quality by city and
        county](https://www.epa.gov/air-trends/air-quality-cities-and-counties)
    -   [EDDMAPS
        Distribution](https://www.eddmaps.org/distribution/uscounty.cfm?sub=5076&map=distribution)
-   **Natural Resources Defense Council Data**
    -   [NRDC
        Dataset](https://www.nrdc.org/climate-change-and-health-air-quality#/map)

## Anticipated coding challenges

-   Dataset crossover (different air pollutants are in varying datasets)
-   Challenges around the geocoding of the map visualizations
