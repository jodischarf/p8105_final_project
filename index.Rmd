The relationship between air quality and asthma has long been established. But it is complex. Asthma triggers can vary based on pollutants, how long an individual has been exposed to these pollutants, and lifestyle. Air quality is unique to geographical location down to the local level, which adds to the difficulty of asthma management.

# Dataset

The data used for the project was obtained from the EPA and the CDC, ranging from the years 2013 - 2020.

Data from the EPA:  
Air quality data is publicly available on the EPA website. We utilized the annual data sets that provided aggregated AQI information based on state. 

**Data from the CDC:**  
Asthma information was collected from BRFFS, the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.   
**Please provide more info here**

We merged the data from these two sources to provide potential for analysis and depiction of the relationship of asthma and AQI.

More details regarding our use of the datasets can be found [here](report.html#data).
